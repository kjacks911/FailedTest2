                For the Independent Study task, I chose to investigate Hungarian literature. I come from a mixed background; my mother’s side is 100% Hungarian while my father’s side is a mixture of ethnicities that even he has never seemed sure about. He describes his ethnic background as a mixture of French, Irish, Scottish, and maybe a few others. This uncertain answer has always made me feel more connected with my Hungarian roots, as I feel more confident of my history on that side of the family. In beginning this project, the first thing I learned was that my grandparents were not born in Hungary as I had always thought but had been born in Canada after their parents immigrated here between 1907-1928. I was always proud of being Hungarian because I thought that gave me gypsy blood. Despite the bad reputation gypsies had, I was always fascinated by their culture. Upon further research, I’ve realized that not all Hungarians are gypsies, and sadly I am not one of them. This project has been interesting because it has given me the time to look further into my heritage. Even while focusing on literature, I have learned a lot outside of a narrow focus. For the purpose of this project, I will limit my report to only significant and relevant information.

            <h3><span class="color-text">Hungarian Literature and History: An Inescapable Entwinement</span></h3>

                Hungary is a country with a rich history that has undeniably impacted their literature. The country has faced many bloody battles, most of which were lost by the Hungarians. The upheavals of war are represented heavily in Hungarian literature as poets and writers are inevitably influenced by their environment. Although they are a nation of lost wars, they have maintained their individuality in spite of social and political changes. Over the centuries, Hungary has risen to the challenge of not allowing itself to be absorbed into neighboring cultures whose power or numbers are greater. Hungarians possess a great deal of national pride for their ability to preserve their national identity in the face of major threats. Their patriotism is reflected in their literature as a result.
            <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                That isn’t to say that Hungarian’s did not view their literature with a critical eye. They compared their country’s state to the material wealth, institutions, and intellectual achievements of the West European countries and found that Hungary was far behind. This did not discourage the Hungarians, but instead, pushed them to work for the improvement of their country’s social structure and intellectual climate even in the face of adversity. The determination to rise above national tragedies of the past is a prominent theme within Hungarian literature.
            <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Writers and poets often became important figures during times of distress. When politicians failed, writers would often find themselves forced to become involved in public affairs to fight for the ideals of their people. Writers as the social and moral conscience of the country was a position that had been a characteristic of East European intellectuals since as early as the 1700’s.
            <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The dominant trait of Hungarian literature is the profound concern of Hungarian writers and poets for their national destiny. The main motive in classical Hungarian literature is awareness of the Hungarian ethos. Ethos is defined as the characteristic spirit of a culture, era, or community as manifested in its beliefs and aspirations. Due to their war-torn history, Hungarian writers and poets are intensely conscious of the tragic obligations that rest upon them. The result is a very close connection between the country’s literature and its history.

            <p>
                Hungarian literature was born out of the cultural and social shock induced by the radical changes that took place in the early centuries of the new Christian culture. Apart from the bible, there was a growing demand for pious texts. Literature acted as a medium of instruction that served the purpose of illustrating religious teachings. Stories that were written to provide enjoyment were usually given a moral conclusion to disguise them.

                A ‘rebirth’ of the Arts and Sciences; the premises of the medieval era no longer seemed valid. Religion was no longer able to provide satisfactory answers to the questions that interested man as society and human relations could no longer be explained in theological terms. The themes that presented themselves were no longer focused on God or Heaven, but man and his natural surroundings

                Hungarian Guards of Maria Theresa was founded. Writers within the Hungarian Guard were traditionally called testőr writers, and they were critical of current Hungarian literature. They believed Hungary to be hopelessly backward, impoverished, and an intellectual desert in comparison to countries in Western Europe. This pushed writers to produce more prominent pieces to enhance their intellectual climate.

            The first half of the 20th Century was considered the Golden Age of Hungarian literature. The Nyugat journal pushlised in 1908 was hailed as the most significant periodical of it's time. The journal spawned a intellectual movement which radiated across Hungary. The literature produced afterward is often seen as mediocre in comparison to the classic masters of the Nyugat period.

                In the years preceding World War I the intellectual horizon narrowed due to the shock caused by the lost war. Large social and economic damaged was inflicted due to the dissolution of Austria-Hungary as a state. Literary life was completely controlled by the Communist Party. Only authors whose writing was approved were able to publish their work.  This large scale restrictions of literary life produced a profound effect on Hungarian literature for years to come. Authors who were denied the facilities of publication had the choice of either leaving the country or keep their writings in their desk drawer. Writers were imprisoned or reported, and many promising careers were irrevocably damaged.

                Joseph Stalin's death gave way to a general easing of tension, often referred to as ‘the thaw’ (title of Ilya Ehrenburg’s novel (1954)) which became the symbol of liberalization. The same year a new liberal policy was inaugurated by Imre Nagy which encouraged writers to cast aside their fears and speak freely. Writers became leaders of a nation-wide reform movement that led to the revolution that broke out on October 23/1956.

                Difficult questions began rising within Hungarian fiction. Hungarians questioned their moral responsibility for the recent past, and confronted shameful memories of the Jewish deportations during the war. With tact and moderation, writers began discussing the gap, still unbridged, between socialist ideals and practice. The theme of ‘The meaning of life’ was popular particularly among the youngest generation, who experienced the horrors of war at a tender age.

                            Ferenc Kazinczy is one of the most important literary figures in Hungarian history for his reform of the language and attempts to improve literary style. He is most well known for his devotion to improving Hungarian linguistics, and the time her served in prison for his political and literary convictions. He was sentenced to seven years for his involvement in the Martinovics conspiracy in 1795. Immediately after his release, he approached Hungarian linguistics with intense devotion. He introduced reforms of spelling, grammar and style that forwarded the movement of linguistic innovations. He has often been called the father of Hungarian literary criticism.

He is the most popular Hungarian author to be published abroad, with ten million copies of his work being printed. His writing possessed strong notes of Hungarian patriotism, and were written in an arch romantic style. His novel Eyes Like the Sea won him the Academy’s Prize in 1890.

                            Endre Ady was a Hungarian poet who was regarded by many as the greatest Hungarian poet of the 20th century. His poems were revolutionary in form, language, and content. His use of unconventional language and unusual choices of adjective shocked the public and gained him widespread attention. For part of his career, he had a narrow and materialistic view of Hungary, which reflected in his poems. The violent insults he directed at the country made him the target of onslaughts that became a political struggle. After World War I he began understanding his country better, and the sufferings of war inspired him to find new ways to express his anger.

                Imre Kertész was a famous Hungarian novelist of Jewish descent. He was born on November 29th, 1929 in Budapest, Hungary. He was a survivor of the German concentration camps that existed during the Nazi regime. As an adolescent, he was deported to the following concentration camps: Auschwitz, Buchenwald, and Zeitz. His works focus on the themes of the Nazi Holocaust, dictatorship and personal freedom. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2002 "for writing that upholds the fragile experience of the individual against the barbaric arbitrariness of history". Fatelessness was his first novel in what ended up being a trilogy reflecting on the Holocaust. Although he had written it in the 1960’s, he was unable to publish it for nearly a decade. After its publication in 1975 it gained little critical attention but gained popularity once it was translated to the German language in 1990. Since then it has been translated to several languages and was adapted to a movie in 2005. On March 31st, 2016, Kertész passed away in his home in Budapest after battling with Parkinson's disease for several years. He is remembered as the first Hungarian to receive a Nobel Prize in Literature for his bodies of work.

                The themes within this novel are easily recognizable in today’s society, and will continue as long as hatred for those that are different still exists. More specifically, cruelty toward those of Jewish descent still presents itself in modern day. Anti-semitic events still appear in the news, such as the defacement of <u><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/world/europe/france-jewish-cemetery-swastikas.html?fbclid=IwAR3kEISdpMeBj_UHuroTJKlmBfm0PPbSxiaIhIA9EyRW2_Xajn_douHsysY" style="color:gray">Holocaust victim tombstones</a></u>, or the <u><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/27/us/pittsburgh-synagogue-active-shooter/index.html?fbclid=IwAR1p8T4ubtY1VMSh1ZfgpQtxUf-AzB6JXn3NGb1fUhM20CFE8llNz5G7l8U" style="color:gray">shooting of a Jewish synagogue in Pittsburgh</a></u>. Both tragedies took place in 2018. The shooter of the Pittsburgh synagogue told police upon arrest that “he wanted all Jews to die”. Hate crimes will continue to take place as long as the existence of the “other” category remains.

                My family's Hungarian heritage has never played a large role within our traditions, and I feel personally distant to the trauma that the Hungarians endured during the Holocaust. As a Canadian student I have been taught about the Holocaust extensively across many years, but reading the personal depiction put forth by Kertész exposed an intimate element of the events that transpired. My research helped shape a new understanding of the Holocaust, and the impact of political events on Hungarian literature.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        In his semi-autobiographical novel Fateless, Imre Kertész explores the themes of self-identity, purpose, and fate in a reworking of his own experience of the Holocaust. The novel is narrated by fourteen-year-old Gyorg Korves, a Jewish boy who lives in the city of Budapest during the Nazi regime. One summer morning in 1944, Gyorg is pulled off the bus he takes to imposed work without warning and herded to a train station with hundreds of other Jews. He then spends a year living in and traveling between concentration camps before being liberated in 1945. During his imprisonment, Gyorg’s thoughts describe his physical and mental deterioration and give insight into how he identifies and interprets the situation. When he arrives home, people make varying demands of him, whether it be broadcasting the horrors he endured to the world or forgetting the whole ordeal and putting it behind him. He longs to connect meaning to his experience and to embrace it as a part of who he has become.

        An important theme within the novel is Gyorg’s effort to understand his identity. He is portrayed as an outsider prior to living in the concentration camps because of his Jewish descent. It is not until his arrival at Auschwitz that he truly begins to feel misplaced. He feels ostracized when he is told by the other prisoners that he “ain’t no Jew” for being unable to speak Yiddish as they do. He finds himself cast in the “other” category even in the lowest circle of the Holocaust. This causes him to contemplate “how peculiar it is to live being aware of his differentness” in a place where he thought he belonged. Upon his release, Gyorg is unable to remember his name but only his prisoner number, signifying the loss of his identity entirely. Once he arrives home, he insists that being Jewish has lost any significance to him at all and that ultimately the only race that exists is humanity.

        Throughout the novel, Gyorg searches for meaning in the way he is being treated. He yearns to connect his experience to something more important to make his suffering seem worthwhile, even if all he gains is self-growth. He chooses not to fault those that torment him and creates humane explanations for his persecutor’s actions. Even when lifeless prisoners are being carted away, Gyorg gives importance to a rumor about the people who are headed to the gas chambers being treated with kindness and affection instead of the inhumane nature of the situation.  His failure to accept the meaninglessness of Nazi brutality is Gyorg’s tragedy. When he arrives home he is told to forget his experience in order to move forward. He explodes that “if his distinctiveness was unimportant, then all this was mere chance, and then all this was utterly without reason”, which would result in his life having lost all meaning. Since he cannot instruct his brain to forget, the only way he is able to move forward is to grow from the experience.

        Fate serves a very important purpose within the novel, given the title of the book. The first instance of fate involves Gyorg’s identity; the fate of the Jewish people. Although he does not place great significance on his Jewish descent, his fate is chosen for him because of it. He does not deny his uncle Lajos’ statement that all Jews share the same dire fate for having turned their faces from the Lord. Gyorg finds solace in this explanation as it would give meaning to his suffering as a sacrifice to prove himself to God. He is often saved by fate as well, such as evading the gas chambers due to the spelling of his last name or being the lifeless body they did not throw into the wagon. His biggest realization is that fate and freedom are at odds and if one exists the other cannot. He decides that in order to survive, an individual will live out any given fate whether they chose it or not, claiming that “we ourselves are fate”.

        The first-person narration of this novel offers an intimate understanding of Gyorg’s interpretation of the Holocaust. The first two chapters allow the reader to observe Gyorg’s thoughts prior to his captivity, which then emphasizes his change in attitude from the trauma he experiences. The novel illustrates society’s tendency to reject those that are different and the exile they often experience because of it. The underlying message exists within the novel that humanity is the only true race, and mankind creates labels to ensure division. The novel also demonstrates the relationship between purpose and survival. In order to find the will to live in the concentration camps, Gyorg believes that he is serving an ultimate purpose. His search for meaning leaves the open question of fate, as fate and freedom are not compatible terms. This suggests that if fate does not exist, then there was something to be done in order to protect their freedom. In this way, an individual might choose to have a preordained over freedom.

            Those last words somehow roused old Steiner. “But what could we do?” he asked, his face part irate, part affronted. “Nothing, naturally,” I said, “or rather, anything,” I added, “which would have been just as senseless as doing nothing, yet again and just as naturally.” “But it’s not about that,” I tried to carry on, to explain it to them. “So what is it about, then?” they asked, almost losing patience, to which I replied, with growing anger on my part as well, I sensed: “It’s about the steps.” Everyone took steps as long as he was able to take a step; I too took my own steps, and not just in the queue at Birkenau, but even before that, here, at home. I took steps with my father, and I took steps with my mother, I took steps with Annamarie, and I took steps ⎯⎯ perhaps the most difficult ones of all ⎯ with the older sister. I would now be able to tell her what it means to be “Jewish”: nothing, nothing to me at least, at the beginning, until those steps start to be taken. None of it is true, there is no different blood, nothing else, only… and I faltered, but suddenly something the journalist had said came to mind: there are only given situations and the new givens inherent in them. I too had lived through it, and I simply couldn’t understand why they couldn’t get it into their heads that I now needed to start doing something with that fate, needed to connect it to somewhere or something; after all, I could no longer be satisfied with the notion that it had all been a mistake, blind fortune, some kind of blunder, let alone that it had not even happened. I could see, and only too well, that they did not really understand, that my words were not much to their liking, indeed it seemed as if one thing or another was actually irritating them. I saw that every now and then Uncle Steiner was about to interrupt or elsewhere about to jump to his feet, but I saw the other old man restraining him, heard him saying, “Leave him be! Can’t you see he only wants to talk? Let him talk! Just leave him be!” and talk I did, albeit possibly to no avail and even a little incoherently. Even so, I made it clear to them that we can never start a new life, only ever carry on the old one. I took the steps, no one else, and I declared that I had been true to my given fate throughout. The sole blot, or one might say fly in the ointment, the sole accident with which they might reproach me was the fact that we should be sitting there talking now ⎯⎯ but then I couldn’t help that. Did they want this whole honesty and all the previous steps I had taken to lose all meaning? Why this sudden about-face, this refusal to accept? Why did they not wish to acknowledge that if there is such a thing as fate, then freedom is not possible ? If, on the other hand ⎯⎯ I swept on, more and more astonished myself, steadily warming to the task ⎯⎯ if there is such a thing as freedom, then there is no fate; that is to say ⎯⎯ and I paused, but only long enough to catch my breath ⎯⎯ that is to say, then we ourselves are fate, I realized all at once, but with a flash of clarity I had never experienced before.

            I found this novel to be a challenging read for several reasons. The most obvious reason being the heavy subject of the novel. I had understood the Holocaust prior to reading Fatelessness, but I had never learned about a personal experience in such detail. There were several excerpts within the novel that were so intense I had to take a break. The upside to this is the impact that the book has. As someone who considers themselves very sensitive to the suffering of others, reading about Gyorg’s deterioration over the span of the year he spent in the concentration camps was a difficult undertaking. It is hard to imagine cruelty like the type that he describes. Not only cruelty, but neglect and hatred. It is a reminder that it is important to understand history in order to prevent tragic events from repeating themselves.

            The second thing I found difficult to read was Kertész’ style of writing. I was not able to read it in Hungarian as I do not speak or read Hungarian. This novel was translated by Tim Wilkinson, and I read that Kertész was very approving of the translation. I found that Kertész would often write in huge run on sentences which would often last the length of an entire paragraph. Since it was a narrative of an adolescent boy, the sentences were meant to mirror his thought process but this presentation of information made it unpleasant to read at times. Since the novel is based on a depiction of his own experiences, there was not a specific climax in the storyline. The journey to his liberation was long, slow, and often dry. The narrative often seemed repetitive and was a struggle to get through at times.

            I enjoyed this novel as I prefer non-fiction over fiction. I chose to read Fatelessness as I have always been interested in learning more about the Holocaust, and Kertész is the only Hungarian writer that has won a Nobel prize for his writing. Since the novel is semi-autobiographical, it felt like I was learning history in the form of a memoir of sorts. It solidified my desire to visit Poland (as well as Hungary) one day to visit Auschwitz and to develop a better understanding of the Holocaust.

            This novel complimented the themes of the English B30 course. I found many parallels within the novel to Lord of the Flies as well as the unit about existentialism. The theme of the people who are different being treated poorly and misunderstood presented itself in both Fatelessness and Lord of the Flies. I found that Gyorg is similar to the character Piggy from LOTF in his desire to be accepted and understood by his peers. Gyorg also has existentialist thoughts by pondering what the meaning of life is, and experiences existentialist angst when he realizes there may be no meaning at all. This story contrasted the Hamlet unit as Gyorg does not resist his imprisonment, but instead meets it with incomprehensible acceptance. Gyorg’s lack of need for retribution is the opposite of Hamlet’s fatal flaw.
